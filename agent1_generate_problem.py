{problems_data}

The student recently solved a {prev_difficulty} problem.
Don't pick another Easy if the last was Easy.
If the last problem was Hard and they failed, suggest Medium.
Try to vary topics if possible. Avoid repeating the same tag (e.g., 'Array') if seen recently: {recent_tags}

Pick one appropriate problem and provide:
- Problem title
- Difficulty
- Link
